# ROS2 Robot Behaviors Project Report

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to become more familiar with ROS2. To do so, we created four unique robot behaviors with a finite state machine integrated into one of them. The behaviors we chose were teleop, draw square, wall follow, person follow, and a finite state machine that implements person follow with an e-stop.website has code for doing that exact thing.
